**wats3020-final-project**

This project requires building a custom content page, creating one that fits into an imaginary site, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make the page attractive and usable.

**Base Requirements**

Come up with the concept for a single-page (at least) experience combining HTML, CSS, and JS.
Come up with a lovely design that does justice to your concept.
Implement your concept and design in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Be sure that your concept meets these technical requirements:
Use at least one third party library (probably jQuery) to assist with base dom manipulation and programming.
Use at least one third party library (perhaps Bootstrap) to assist with some aspect of visual presentation and/or visual effects (you could also use a third party animation library, etc.).
Use at least one third party library to incorporate data from a remote service. (This could be implementation of a mapping library like Leaflet.js, some JS components for Flickr or Twitter, or a completely custom API request/feature that you create using "ajax()" or "getJSON()" methods.
Use at least one event listener to respond to a user's click. (This could be doing a show/hide on content, simulating a login, triggering an animation, etc.)
Your design and layout must be responsive for the four common sizes of screen: sm, md, lg, xl.
Stretch Goals

Use an animation library to do a vertical scrolling animation.
Use another special library to make a very specific presentation that would not be possible without JavaScript.
